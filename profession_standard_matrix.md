## Key Insights

### Phase Evolution Patterns

1. **Discovery Phase**: Focus on understanding users (UCD), basic technical setup (Architecture & Software Development), and initial delivery processes (Delivery Management)

2. **Alpha Phase**: Introduction of Business Analysis for agile processes and tool selection, expansion of Architecture and Software Development involvement, increased Quality Assurance focus

3. **Beta (Private)**: All professions become active, Release Management introduced for operational concerns

4. **Beta (Public)**: Similar to Private Beta but with some variations in Business Analysis and Product Management involvement

5. **Live Phase**: Operational focus with sustained involvement from most professions, particularly for maintenance and continuous improvement

### Profession Focus Areas

- **User-Centred Design**: Consistently involved in user-focused standards (1-5) across all phases
- **Architecture**: Heavy involvement in technical standards (8, 9, 11-14) especially in later phases, focusing on system design and solution architecture
- **Software Development**: Heavy involvement in technical standards (8, 9, 11-14) especially in later phases, focusing on code development and implementation
- **Delivery Management**: Focus on operational and process standards (8, 9, 14, 15)
- **Product Management**: Strategic standards around users, agile processes, and success metrics
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing and reliability standards (5, 9, 10, 14)
- **Business Analysis**: Agile processes and technology decisions in later phases
- **Release Management**: Operational reliability primarily in Beta and Live phases

### Architecture vs Software Development

Both **Architecture** and **Software Development** professions cover the same technical standards, reflecting that:

- Architecture focuses on system design, solution architecture, and technical strategy
- Software Development focuses on code implementation, development practices, and technical delivery
- Both professions collaborate on technical standards covering tools, security, reliability, open source, and accessibility

This matrix provides a framework for understanding which professions should be involved in assessing each standard at different phases of a digital service delivery project.
